#### Client side
The client side consists of:
- components ``./client/src/components``
- basic modules ``./client/src/modules``, which contain all the necessary resources for proper functioning, 
- pages ``./client/src/pages`` that consist of modules and do not contain business logic.
- a router ``./client/src/router`` that provides routing to the pages
- redux ``./client/src/redux`` that contains the global state and provides data exchange between modules
- utilities ``./client/src/utils`` that provide authentication functions ``/utils/useAuth.js``, server requests ``/utils/useHttps.js`` and data preparation ``/utils/_transformData.js``for display on the page
